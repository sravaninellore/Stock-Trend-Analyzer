 Stock Trend Analyzer   

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast stock price movements and identify market trends based on historical financial data. This model aims to provide valuable insights for investors and traders, aiding them in making informed decisions and optimizing their portfolio management strategies.

The project involves analyzing stock market data obtained from Wikipedia or news channel using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The analysis will utilize libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, and technical indicators for feature extraction. Machine learning algorithms will be employed to train predictive models, and the results will be evaluated for accuracy and reliability.

The model will be saved using the pickle library, and an interactive web application will be created using Streamlit. This application will allow users to input stock details and receive predictions and trend analyses in real-time.
